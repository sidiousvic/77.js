- Trained on the [Prime String](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-116-prime-string/solutions?show-solutions=1) challenge on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).
- The challenge is to find if a string is made up of a pattern repeated more than one time. If a consistent pattern is not present, return `true`. If the string can be divided into duplicate chunks, return `false`.
- This is a sick solution:

```js
function primeString(s) {
  return (s + s).indexOf(s, 1) == s.length;
}
```

- First, we concatenate the string `s` with itself, doubling it.
- We can search for the pattern by assuming that we can find `s` before the midpoint of this duplicate, because if there is a pattern, `s` will span the halfway point of `s`:

`abab + abab = abababab`

`Original` **abab**abab
`Midway` ab**abab**ab
`Duplicate` abab**abab**

`abcxy + abcxy = abcxyacbxy`

`Original` **abcxy**acbxy
`Midway` abcxyacbxy
`Duplicate` abcxy**acbxy**

- If the original `s` does not occur until the duplicate `s` begins, then the string is prime and has no repeating pattern.
- We can check this by returning `true` if an `indexOf()` search beggining at index 1 (so as to not count the beggining `s` pattern) returns a number equal to the length of `s`.

- Completed the [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-or-5/train/javascript) challenge on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).
- Learned how to make an array of successive integers leading up to `n` using `[...Array(n).keys()]`. This uses the `...` operator to make a new `Array` of `n` length containing its own `keys()`. Note, such an array will always begin at 0.
