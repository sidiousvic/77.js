- Trained on the [Prime String](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-116-prime-string/solutions?show-solutions=1) challenge on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).
- The challenge is to find if a string is made up of a pattern repeated more than one time. If a consistent pattern is not present, return `true`. If the string can be divided into duplicate chunks, return `false`.
- This is a sick solution:

```js
function primeString(s) {
  return (s + s).indexOf(s, 1) == s.length;
}
```

- First, we concatenate the string `s` with itself, doubling it.
- We can search for the pattern by assuming that we can find `s` before the midpoint of this duplicate, because if there is a pattern, `s` will span the halfway point of `s`:

`abab + abab = abababab`

`Original` **abab**abab
`Midway` ab**abab**ab
`Duplicate` abab**abab**

`abcxy + abcxy = abcxyacbxy`

`Original` **abcxy**acbxy
`Midway` abcxyacbxy
`Duplicate` abcxy**acbxy**

- If the original `s` does not occur until the duplicate `s` begins, then the string is prime and has no repeating pattern.
- We can check this by returning `true` if an `indexOf()` search beggining at index 1 (so as to not count the beggining `s` pattern) returns a number equal to the length of `s`.

- Completed the [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-or-5/train/javascript) challenge on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).
- Learned how to make an array of successive integers leading up to `n` using `[...Array(n).keys()]`. This uses the `...` operator to make a new `Array` of `n` length containing its own `keys()`. Note, such an array will always begin at 0.

- Began working on the JavaScript track on [Exercism](https://www.exercism.io).
- Installed Exercism through the terminal, learned how to use exports and imports to abide by the testing system.

## Fri 03 May 2019

- Completed three simple exercises on [Exercism](https://www.exercism.io).

- Completed the [Gigasecond](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/f061907157864d4ea1db922718e9cb92) exercise on [Exercism](https://www.exercism.io).
- Learned how to calculate the date after `n` seconds from an inital `Date` object.

```js
const gigaseconds = date => {
  return new Date(date.setSeconds(date.getSeconds() + 1000000000));
};
```

- `setSeconds()` will change a `date`'s seconds value. `getSeconds()` will return a `date`'s seconds value.
- Completed mate Rafa's squareX challenge, wherein we have to create a function that takes a number `n`, and logs a square of `n` rows and `n` columns of stars or spaces. The stars must only be printed as the square's outline as well as diagonal lines across its corners, forming an inner x.
- To complete it, we have to make a loop to print a string `n` times, then an inner loop to print a star `*` or space `` `n` times in each line.
- To decide when to print a star or a space, we make a comprehensive `if` statement within the nested loop.
- Completed the [RNA Transcription](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/0ace52e59e9b4946b8b0afed8fd93601) exercise on [Exercism](https://www.exercism.io).

- Completed the [Space Age](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/40a827e79c684acc8322a6b3b5933099) exercise on [Exercism](https://www.exercism.io).
- Given a `planet` and a `seconds` input representing someone's age in seconds, return how many years old they would be on each of the 8 planets, according to their orbital period.
- Placed the orbital periods of each planet in an `orbitalPeriods` object, then mapped them into a `planetYearInSeconds` object with their orbital periods in seconds, knowing 1 Earthyear = 31557600 seconds.
- Returned `seconds` divided by the `planet` value in `planetYearInSeconds` then contain to two decimal spaces and parse as number with `+().toFixed(2)`.

## Tue 07 May 2019

- Began working on my first React project.
- Learned how to create a new React project using `create-react-app` and set it up with [npm](npmjs.com) using the flag `--use-npm`.

```js
create-react-app nameoftheapp --use-npm
```

- Built my first React component by following three simple steps.

1. Import the react and react dom libraries

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```

2. Create the react component

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button style={{ backgroundColor: "blue", color: "white" }}>
        {buttonText}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

3. Render the component on the screen

```js
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector("#root"));
```

- Learned about important differences in JSX and HTML syntax, such as passing objects as inline styles with double brackets `{{...}}` and camelCasing style properties such as `background-color` `=>` `backgroundColor`

## Wed 08 May 2019

- Learned how to use libraries like [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) to apply default styling and [Faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js) to dynamically call random fake data for components in a React project.
- Learned about how JSX handles variables within curly braces `{...}`.
- Learned how to create and import a component file into the index file of a project.

At the end of component file:

```js
export default CommentDetail;
```

At the top of index.js file:

```js
import CommentDetail from "./CommentDetail";
```

- Learned how to pass `props` as an argument in a component and then reference it within it using something like `props.author`.

In the component:

```js
const CommentDetail = props => {

// some sh*t here

  <div className="content">
    <a href="/" className="author" />
    {props.author}
  </div> // {props.author} is the reference

// some more sh*t here
```

In index.js file:

```js
<CommentDetail author="Vic" /> // this is the inline property
```
