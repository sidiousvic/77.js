- Still working on [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects: Cash Register](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register/) on freeCodeCamp.
- Accounted for first two scenarios, `CLOSED` and `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` by simply comparing the `change` variable to `reg` for less than or equal to, respectively.
- Tried reversing the `cid` array in order to subtract denominations starting from highest to lowest.

## Wed 03 Apr 2019

- Completed [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects: Cash Register](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register/) on freeCodeCamp.
- For last scenario, created an array `denom` of denomination `name:val` (_val_ as in _value_) pairs from highest to lowest, and an array `register` of denominations in `cid` in the same format as `denom`.
- Looping through each denomination `billcoin` in `denom`, we subtract each `billcoin` value from `change` and `register` as long (`while`) as any such denomination remains in `register` and change is more or equal to zero.
- To a variable `value` resetted each loop, we add the total of the `billcoin` used at the nested `while` loop. If a `billcoin` was used, we `push()` its name along with `value` as a subarray to the `change` object array.
- If we did not `push()` any subarrays into `change`, that means that we cannot give exact change, and thus we account for the last remaining scenario as we return `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` and the empty `change` array.
- If we did modify `change`, we simply return its parent `output` in the end.

- Began to refactor the **Intermediate Algorithm Scripting** challenges on freeCodeCamp, RRC
- Refactored and commented [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Numbers in a Range](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range) on freeCodeCamp.
- We `sort()` both array elements from low to high, then push all consecutive numbers to a `result` array starting from the first element until the last using a `for` loop. Finally, we return the sum of all numbers in `result` using `reduce()`.

- Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Diff Two Arrays](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/diff-two-arrays) on freeCodeCamp.
- Used `[].concat(arguments)` to create a new array combining the elements of all arguments.
- Used `includes()` as a condition with `filter()` to weed out the elements present in both arrays, returning only the unique ones.
- Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Seek and Destroy](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/seek-and-destroy) on freeCodeCamp.
- Merged the arguments into a single new array `xargs` using `[].concat(arguments)` and sliced off the array argument to leave only the extra arguments, our tests.
- Using `filter()`, we return the elements that don't match our test arguments.
- Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Wherefore Art Thou?](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/wherefore-art-thou) on freeCodeCamp.
- Made an array `sourcekeys` from the `source` argument objects' keys using `Object.keys()`.
- Using `map()`, tested whether each key in `sourcekeys` exists in a particular object from `collection`, and if their value pairs are the same.
- Using `reduce()`, aggregated all returned booleans into a single value.
- Using `filter()`, we pass an element into our return array only if the above tests reduced to true.
- Updated all functions in [study.js/exercises] to ES6 arrow function syntax.

- Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Spinal Tap Case](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/spinal-tap-case) on freeCodeCamp.
- Created a regex to identify underscores, spaces, and using a positive lookahead for capital letters, camelcase.
- We then split at regex using `split(regex)`, join with hyphens using `join(-)`, and convert to lowercase using `toLowerCase()`.
- Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Pig Latin](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/pig-latin) on freeCodeCamp.
- Built regex `vowels` to match all vowels in a string, and `vowel` to match the first letter in a string only if it is a vowel.
- `split()` will delete the element at which we split, and so if `split(vowels)` matches the first element, it will return an array with an empty first element. Otherwise, it will return an array with a consonant or consonant cluster as the first element. Chaining this with `shift()`, we return such first element, finally adding `+ "ay"` to it and storing it in a variable `xay`.

`glove` => `[gl, o, v, e]` => `gl` => `glay`

- Using the same logic, we `replace()` the first consonant cluster `str.split(vowels)[0]` with nothing and store it in a variable `pig`.

`glove` => `gl,o,v,e` => `ove`

- Using an `if` statement and our regex `vowel`, we check whether the string begins with a vowel. If it does, we simply return the word as is, plus `"ay"`.
- Otherwise, if the string does not begin with a vowel, we return `pig` plus `xay`.

- Revisited the exercise [each.js](exercises/each.js). The objective is to create a function that takes a `collection` parameter (array or object) and executes a second `callback` parameter on all of its elements.
- Declared a test function `timesNine` that takes a number and multiplies it by nine.
- Within a main `each` function, we iterate each element of the `collection` using `for(let ... in ...)` and equalize each of its elements to the result of passing that element through our `callback` function.
- We log and return the modified collection.
- Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Search and Replace](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/search-and-replace) on freeCodeCamp.
- First find the index at which `before` begins. Using that, we can check if the character at that index in `str` is uppercase or not.
- We then store the first letter of `after` in a `capital` variable, capitalized, and store `after` without the first letter in a `rest` variable.
- We assign `capital` + `rest` to `after`.
- In the end, using `replace()` we substitute `before` with `after` in `str`.

- Had my third interview with [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/). As expected, the challenge the interviewer gave me was different from what I had done before. I failed.
- The task was to swap an object's `key: value` pairs.
- Got stuck while assuming that logging an object's keys with a for loop would return indexes (0, 1, 2, 3) instead of the keys ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') themselves. Sadly, did not simply log them to check.
- Will study objects thoroughly to prepare for the follwing check-in next week.

## Wed 10 Apr 2019

- Built a `swap` function that takes an object as an argument and returns an object with its `key: value` pairs swapped.
- Inside the function, declared a variable `result` and assinged to it an empty object.
- Using a for loop, we iterate through each key of the object argument.
- We then assign each iterated element to a variable `key` and the object's element to a variable `value`.
- We fill `result` initializing the pairs swapped.

```js
for (let elem in object) {
  let key = elem;
  let value = object[elem];
  result[value] = key;
}
```

- Passed the [Simple Pig Latin](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-pig-latin/train/javascript) kata on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).
- Built a function `pigIt()` that takes a sentence string and replaces each word with its Pig Latin equivalent. The function ignores punctuation.
- Learned how to use a `replace()` method with a regex split into [capturing groups](https://javascript.info/regexp-groups).

```js
/(\w)(\w*)(\s|$)/g;
```

- The capturing groups are enclosed by parentheses `()` and can be referred to at the replacement parameter, in order of appearance starting with `$1`.

  > - `(\w)` a word character (first letter of a word) is `$1`
  > - `(\w*)` a word characte, greedy (rest of the letters in a word), is `$2`
  > - `(\s|$)` a space or the end of a line, is `$3`

- The format of Pig Latin we are looking for is `(word without first letter)` + `(first letter)` + `"ay"` + `(any punctuation)`.
- Thus our replacement will be `$2` + `$1` + `"ay"` + `$3`, or `"$2$1ay$3"`.
- The punctuation (?!.:;) remains in its place unmodified.

- Passed the [Mexican Wave](https://www.codewars.com/kata/mexican-wave/train/javascript) kata on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).
- Built a function that emulates a stadium wave over a string, returning an array of versions of the string with each non-space character uppercased.
- We loop over every character in array, including spaces.
- Every loop, we create an `arr` variable holding an array of each character by using `split('')`.
- At same loop, using `splice()` we replace the current character in `arr` with its own uppercase version.
- We `push()` the modified `arr` after stitching it back together using `join()` to an empty `result` array residing outside the loop.
- Every loop a new `arr` is created. This is key because each `arr` will only exist for the duration of its loop, allowing us to `splice()` and `push()` a different version each time.
- On our `wave()` function scope, we return `result` after filtering out all-lowercase versions of `arr`, generated when we modified an empty space character.

- Attempted the [Number of trailing zeros of N!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52f787eb172a8b4ae1000a34/train/javascript) challenge on CodeWars. After solving it in a convoluted way, learned a better and simpler method.
- We must find how many fives are in the factorial of `n`.
- To do that, we can simply loop and divide `n` by five, truncate it down to a whole number, and add that to a result variable until n is _falsey_, or `0`.
- We must account incrementing extra zeroes for 25 (1 extra zero), 125 (2 extra zeros), and so on.
- Since 5 divided by five returns one, and one is _truey_, we account for that extra zero at the very final loop each time by adding one to result.

- Passed the [Validate Credit Card Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/validate-credit-card-number/train/javascript) challenge on CodeWars.
- First, turned the number into a `ccn` array using `toString()`, `split()`, and `map()` with `parseInt()`.
- Then, made a series of conditional statements regarding `ccn`'s length. If even, multiply every number at even indexes, if not, do so at uneven indexes.

```js
for (let num in ccn) {
    // if array length is even, multiply number at even indexes
    if (ccn.length % 2 === 0) {
      if (num % 2 === 0) ccn[num] = ccn[num] * 2;
      // if array is not even, multiply number at odd indexes
    } else {
      if (num % 2 !== 0) ccn[num] = ccn[num] * 2;
    }
```

- Right after, check if the multiplied number is more than 9. If it is, subtract 9. (Which is the same as the sum of both digits in such number, e.g. `10 => 1 + 0 = 1` = `10 - 9 = 1`)

```js
if (ccn[num] > 9) ccn[num] -= 9;
result.push(ccn[num]);
```

- Finally return whether the sum of the modified `ccn` array, when divided by 10, equals 0.

```js
return result.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) % 10 === 0;
```

- Passed the [A Rule of Divisibility by 13](https://www.codewars.com/kata/a-rule-of-divisibility-by-13/train/javascript) challenge on CodeWars.
- Learned how to loop recursively through an array/object, by dividing the iterator over the array's length and using the remainder as the current index:

```js
let nines = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9];
let elevens = [11, 111, 1111];
for (let x in nines) {
  console.log(nines[x] * elevens[x % elevens.length]);
}

// 99
// 999
// 9999
// 99
// 999
// 9999

- Passed the [Maximum Subarray Sum](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54521e9ec8e60bc4de000d6c/train/javascript) challenge on CodeWars by implementing [this version of Kadane's Algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32367032/kadanes-algorithm-explained).
- We create two variables, `sum` and `max`.
- `sum` is the result of adding `sum` to the current value every time, using `Math.max()` to set a lower limit of 0. This effectively gives us the maximum sum in the subsequence **so far**, because sum can only increment itself or become zero (which is higher than any negative number).
- We store `sum` in `max` if it is higher than `max`. This lets us record our highest ever sum.

- Passed the [Greed is Good](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5270d0d18625160ada0000e4/train/javascript) challenge on CodeWars.
- Using an object storing all possible score combinations, then transcoding our inputs into the same format, we can map the input to its corresponding score, filter combinations that have no points value out, and then return the sum of points.

```js
let scores = {
    "1x1": 100,
    "1x2": 200,
    "1x3": 1000,
    "1x4": 1100,
    ...
```

```js
let d = [4, 4, 4, 2, 5].sort(); // [ 2, 4, 4, 4, 5 ]
let counts = {};
d.forEach(x => (counts[x] = (counts[x] || 0) + 1));
console.log(d);

// { "2": 1, "4": 3, "5": 1 }
```

```js
let a = [];
for (let x in counts) {
  a.push(x + "x" + counts[x]);
}
console.log(a);
